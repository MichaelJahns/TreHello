My unique interpretation of a a trello board

### Log

##### Day Three
* Adjusts where users can go

* Road Maps Next steps

##### Day Two
* Adjust Styling
* Reformats Task Form to better control inputs
* Sets up Firebase Auth for Email

Blocked
* My desired approach for setting state is dependent on users seeing other users, users being able to create teams, and users being able to assign a Task based off the Team associated with it. Requires Unique Task Pages for edditing purposes

##### Day One
* Wires Firebase
