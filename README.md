# TreHello
My unique interpretation of a a trello board

### Log

##### Day Five
* Device Id is now being saved to a user account preferences on every save
* Members with their device ID set can now recieve background notifications

##### Day Four
* Adjusts the task view page to allow the creation, and joinging of teams, Teams are a POJO object that has a top level reference in NOSQL
* Removes TaskView and plans to integrate that into the profile Viewer
* When a user clicks on a user in the team recycler they are taken to that users profile page
* Repairs broken editProfileRoute

##### Day Three
* Adjusts where users can go
* Adds user profiles, the ability to edit user profiles, and redirects for users who havent
* Road Maps Single Task View, and User Tasks View
* Adjusts timing and reloads for better user experience

##### Day Two
* Adjust Styling
* Reformats Task Form to better control inputs
* Sets up Firebase Auth for Email
* Toggle Button for Log Actions

Blocked
* My desired approach for setting state is dependent on users seeing other users, users being able to create teams, and users being able to assign a Task based off the Team associated with it. Requires Unique Task Pages for edditing purposes

##### Day One
* Wires Firebase
* Creates Recycle Viewer

WIP
* Populate Recycler Viewer with Tasks
