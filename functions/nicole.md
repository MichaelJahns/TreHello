Challenge name: Santize whitespace

Interpreted the question: 9/10 pts
2/2 points: Asked meaningful clarifying questions
2/2 points: Identified inputs and outputs 
1/2 points: Visually illustrated the problem domain
4/4 points: Identified optimal data structure and algorithm 

Notes: 
A problem like this can be hard to design fancy visual, but pictures can be the most illuminating into your thought process

Regex is a one-line solution and so Id call that the best solution, but would that be considered a built in array method? Idk

Solved the technical problem: 11/12 pts
4/4 points: Presented & understood a working algorithm
2/3 points: Final code was syntactically correct 
3/3 points: Final code was idiomatically correct
2/2 points: Solution was the best possible option
Notes: 
Two very good catches in the form of char single quotes and .equals for strings

char[] should be lower case

fixed the problem in the solution during the walkthrough

Analyzed the proposed solution: 6/6 pts
2/2 points: Stepped through their solution
2/2 points: Big O time and space are analyzed
2/2 points: Explain an approach to testing
Notes:
In your walkthrough, label what everything is for clarity. This is the input, this is the output, this is the charArray. It can become jumbled very quickly if you do not. 

Communicated effectively throughout: 9/12 pts
4/6 points: Verbalized their thought process
1/2 points: Used correct terminology
1/1 point: Used the time available effectively
1/1 point: Was not overconfident (not listening to suggestions)
1/1 point: Was not under-confident (unsure of known algorithm)
1/1 point: Whiteboard was readable (penmanship and spacing)
Notes:
Silent for large tracks of time

There were instances where your language was very loose, thing thingy etc. 

Total Points: 35/40 (giving up is an automatic fail)
